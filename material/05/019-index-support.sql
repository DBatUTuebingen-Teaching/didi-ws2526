-- DuckDB implements basic support for ART indexes but will the indexes
-- only to evaluate simple (non-composite) predicates.
--
-- 1. DuckDB uses ART to evaluate selective predicates p of the form
--    c = val (index lookup) or c > val (index traversal with leaf scan).
--
-- 2. DuckDB does not use ARTs to evaluate conjunctions (disjunctions)
--    p AND q (p OR q) even if p and/or q could be evaluated using ARTs.
--
-- 3. DuckDB does not use composite indexes for predicate evaluation
--    (but uses such indexes for checking mulit-column PRIMARY KEY
--    or UNIQUE constraints).
--
-- 4. DuckDB does not use ARTs to evaluate LIKE-style predicates
--    (internally these are rewritten into conjunctive predicates, see 2.)
--
-- 5. DuckDB does not use indexes to evaluate ORDER BY.
--
-- 6. DuckDB does not use indexes to evaluate min/max aggregates.

-- instance (sf = 100).

--                               conjunction

-- Index-based plan alternatives:
--
-- A. Use index orders(o_clerk), then FILTER on o_orderkey < 6000001
-- B. Use index orders(o_orderkey), then FILTER on o_clerk = 'Clerk#000051887'
-- C. Use composite index orders(o_clerk, o_orderkey) with a lookup
--    on the concatenated key 'Clerk#000051887|6000001', then scan
--    leaves leftwards
-- D. Use indexes orders(o_clerk) and orders(o_orderkey), obtain two
--    sets of rowids, perform rowid set INTERSECTION (PostgreSQL implements
--    this based by bit-wise AND on bitmaps that represent the rowid sets)


-- Disjunctions are trickier to evaluate (zonemaps for two columns have
-- to be considered to identify the irrelevant row groups).  DuckDB
-- does not push the disjunction into Sequential Scan but uses a
-- post-FILTER step

-- 4. LIKE-style patterns (%: match any [empty] substring, _: match any
--    character) are translated into conjunctive predicates behind the
--    scenes.  In consequence, Index Scan is not applied :-/

-- DuckDB rewrites the pattern match into (pushed down into Sequential Scan)

-- The pushed down predicates reduces row volume from 150,000,000
-- to 15,000,000 rows to save 90% work that would hit ~~ otherwise.

--    can scan the leaves in forward/backward fashion

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT o.o_orderkey       -- narrow SELECT clause, scanning the leaves

--    minimum (maximum) value.  DuckDB does not exploit that.
