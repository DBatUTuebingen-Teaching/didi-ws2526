026-unroll.c

Assess the effect of loop unrolling: replicate the instructions
inside a loop to increase the ratio of useful work being done
over the necessary (for-)loop control.  In this code, the loop
has been unrolled four times.  Note that the unrolled routine
only performs correctly for vector sizes that are divisble by 4.

Compile via

  cc -Wall -O2 -fno-vectorize -fno-unroll-loops 026-unroll.c -o -026-unroll

Execute via

  ./026-unroll       # measure loop runtime, NO unrolling performed
  ./026-unroll -u    # measure runtime of unrolled loop
